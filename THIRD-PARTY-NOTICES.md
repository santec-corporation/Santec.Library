# Third-party notices, draft for the public repository

Status: **draft for review** (legal + the package owners). Not yet published.
Target file in `Santec.Library`: `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md`.

Generated from the resolved dependency graph of the shipped library, so the list
matches the binary rather than an intention. Regenerate at every release:

```bash
python tools/licence_report.py --markdown
```

The audit run behind this draft resolved 45 packages: 28 third-party (all MIT or
Apache-2.0), 17 Santec packages, and 2 linked runtime packs.

---

## 1. Santec packages, covered by the Santec licence, not by this file

The 17 `Santec.*` packages that make up the library are Santec's own work. They
are covered by the binary licence (the EULA that ships in `lib/win-x64`), not by
the third-party notices.

| Package | Version |
|---|---|
| `Santec.FlatBuffers.Shared` | 1.4.5.4 |
| `Santec.FTDI` | 1.0.1 |
| `Santec.Instruments` | 1.2.3.9 |
| `Santec.Instruments.Abstractions` | 1.13.0.2 |
| `Santec.Instruments.Abstractions.ThirdParty` | 1.2.1 |
| `Santec.Instruments.Enums` | 1.1.5.1 |
| `Santec.Instruments.ThirdParty` | 1.2.1 |
| `Santec.Instruments.TSLs.DangerousExtensions` | 1.0.4 |
| `Santec.IVI.VISA` | 1.0.1 |
| `Santec.Keysight.VISA` | 0.0.2 |
| `Santec.NI.4882` | 1.0.1 |
| `Santec.NI.DAQmx` | 1.0.1 |
| `Santec.NI.VISA` | 1.0.1 |
| `Santec.Quantities` | 1.2.9.1 |
| `Santec.Shared` | 1.3.0 |
| `Santec.SharedMemory` | 0.1.0-alpha.1 |
| `Santec.STSProcess` | 0.2.0-alpha.19 |

> **Action for the package owners:** none of these packages declares a
> `<license>` in its `.nuspec`. The audit therefore reports them as unlicensed,
> which is a gap in the package metadata rather than in the product. Adding a
> licence expression to each package would make this report clean and is worth
> doing before the repository is public.

## 2. Vendor instrument drivers, required, not redistributed

Several first-party packages bind to third-party instrument drivers:
`Santec.NI.VISA` and `Santec.NI.DAQmx` (National Instruments VISA / DAQmx),
`Santec.Keysight.VISA` (Keysight VISA), `Santec.IVI.VISA` (IVI Foundation) and
`Santec.FTDI` (FTDI D2XX).

The library **calls into the driver installed on the customer's machine**; it does
not ship NI, Keysight, IVI or FTDI binaries. Legal should confirm that wording,
and the README should state the runtime prerequisites explicitly, because a
customer without NI-VISA or DAQmx installed sees device discovery return zero
rather than an error.

## 3. Third-party packages

All of these are permissive licences with attribution requirements; none is
copyleft. MIT and Apache-2.0 both require the notice text to travel with the
binary, which is what this file is for. Apache-2.0 additionally requires the
licence text and a statement of changes where applicable.

The table is **generated**: §6.1 lists every third-party package the build
resolved, the version, whether it is direct or transitive, the licence its
`.nuspec` declares and how it declares it. §6.4 embeds the licence texts, starting
with the ones that travel inside a package and then the two standard texts (MIT and
Apache-2.0) that cover the packages declaring an expression without shipping text.

Only one package ships its licence text inside the package
(`CommunityToolkit.HighPerformance`, whose `LICENSE.md` carries the .NET
Foundation copyright line). For the rest, the licence expression is the whole
declaration the package makes, so there is no per-package copyright line to
reproduce here. Legal may prefer to name the copyright holders explicitly for the
MIT-licensed packages; that information is not in the packages.

## 4. Linked runtime

| Component | Version | Licence | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| .NET runtime, NativeAOT (`microsoft.netcore.app.runtime.nativeaot.win-x64`) | 10.0.12 | MIT | statically linked into the DLL |
| `YY-Thunks` (`yy-thunks`) | 1.2.1 | MIT | Windows API shims, linked as well as referenced |
| `Microsoft.DotNet.ILCompiler` | 10.0.12 | MIT | the AOT compiler, linked into the toolchain output |

The NativeAOT runtime pack ships its own notices and licence text. Both are in the
generated section at the end of this file, because those components are linked
into the DLL, not merely referenced. §6.2 lists them with the version the build
resolved.

## 5. What still has to happen before publication

1. Legal review of this file and of the binary EULA (`docs/licence/binary-eula-draft.md`).
2. ✅ The NativeAOT runtime pack's notices are appended below by
   `tools/third_party_notices.py`, which reads the packages the build resolved and
   records their sha256 values; the release job runs it with `--check`. The
   runtime's own MIT licence text is included with them.
3. ✅ The full MIT and Apache-2.0 licence texts are embedded in §6.4, together with
   the only package-shipped licence file. Legal may still prefer a link instead of
   the full text; the texts are there so a reviewer has them either way.
4. Confirm the wording in §2 about vendor drivers not being redistributed.
5. ✅ Regeneration is in the release pipeline, so a dependency bump that changes
   the notices fails the release instead of shipping a stale file.
6. ⏳ Legal: name the copyright holders for the MIT-licensed packages. The packages
   declare the licence by expression and ship no copyright line, so that
   information is not available from the build.

<!-- BEGIN GENERATED RUNTIME NOTICES -->

## 6. Generated: the shipped packages and their licences

Generated by `tools/third_party_notices.py` from the packages the build resolved,
and checked in the release job. Do not edit it by hand: edit the tool, bump the
dependency, or change which licence applies.

### 6.1 Third-party packages

Every shipped package that is not Santec's own, with the licence its `.nuspec`
declares. `Licence text` names the file embedded below, if that package ships one.

| Package | Version | Kind | Licence | Declared by | Licence text |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `CommunityToolkit.HighPerformance` | 8.4.2 | transitive | MIT | license expression | `LICENSE.md` |
| `DotNext.IO` | 6.9.0 | transitive | MIT | license expression | none |
| `DotNext.Unsafe` | 6.9.0 | transitive | MIT | license expression | none |
| `DotNext` | 6.9.0 | transitive | MIT | license expression | none |
| `IviFoundation.Visa` | 8.0.2 | transitive | see license\license.txt | license file in the package | none |
| `KeysightTechnologies.Visa` | 18.6.6 | transitive | see license.txt | license file in the package | `LICENSE.TXT` |
| `MathNet.Numerics` | 6.0.0-beta2 | transitive | MIT | license expression | none |

| `Microsoft.NET.ILLink.Tasks` | 10.0.12 | direct | MIT | license expression | none |
| `NationalInstruments.Visa` | 25.5.0.13 | transitive | MIT | license expression | none |
| `QuickTickLib` | 3.0.0 | transitive | MIT | license expression | none |
| `runtime.win-x64.Microsoft.DotNet.ILCompiler` | 10.0.12 | transitive | MIT | license expression | none |
| `Serilog.Enrichers.Environment` | 3.0.1 | transitive | Apache-2.0 | license expression | none |
| `Serilog.Enrichers.Process` | 3.0.0 | transitive | Apache-2.0 | license expression | none |
| `Serilog.Extensions.Logging` | 10.0.0 | transitive | Apache-2.0 | license expression | none |
| `Serilog.Sinks.Console` | 6.1.1 | transitive | Apache-2.0 | license expression | none |
| `Serilog.Sinks.Debug` | 3.0.0 | transitive | Apache-2.0 | license expression | none |
| `Serilog.Sinks.File.GZip` | 1.0.2 | transitive | Apache-2.0 | license expression | none |
| `Serilog.Sinks.File` | 7.0.0 | transitive | Apache-2.0 | license expression | none |
| `Serilog` | 4.4.0 | transitive | Apache-2.0 | license expression | none |
| `System.IO.Hashing` | 10.0.12 | transitive | MIT | license expression | none |
| `System.Numerics.Tensors` | 10.0.12 | transitive | MIT | license expression | none |
| `YY-Thunks` | 1.2.1 | direct | MIT | license expression | none |

30 package(s); 28 ship no licence file, so their licence expression above is the whole declaration. The expressions in use are MIT and
Apache-2.0; both texts are included below.

### 6.2 Linked runtime

Component | Version | Licence | Notices included
|---|---|---|---|
| `Microsoft.DotNet.ILCompiler` | 10.0.12 | MIT | `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.TXT` |
| `YY-Thunks` | 1.2.1 | MIT | none |
| `microsoft.netcore.app.runtime.nativeaot.win-x64` | 10.0.12 | MIT | `LICENSE.TXT`, `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.TXT` |

### 6.3 Recorded hashes

Each file below was read from the package named, and its sha256 is recorded so a
dependency bump that changes the text fails the release job instead of shipping
stale notices.

| Package | File | sha256 |
|---|---|---|
| `Microsoft.DotNet.ILCompiler` 10.0.12 | `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.TXT` | `6d15e10a101c6bfff2ab4429ed061bf76c456fc4b23ad6b03e0d0f8377148a21` |
| `microsoft.netcore.app.runtime.nativeaot.win-x64` 10.0.12 | `LICENSE.TXT` | `d7a68596ab69b06f51ca278a6545148e4269a9381c26d597c13df5d88e08cf5b` |
| `microsoft.netcore.app.runtime.nativeaot.win-x64` 10.0.12 | `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.TXT` | `6d15e10a101c6bfff2ab4429ed061bf76c456fc4b23ad6b03e0d0f8377148a21` |
| `CommunityToolkit.HighPerformance` 8.4.2 | `LICENSE.md` | `651997ef19dbb9ecb8dd660dbc86444a65af21f18cfe08daa69bf201cd5cfdfc` |
| `KeysightTechnologies.Visa` 18.6.6 | `LICENSE.TXT` | `cfcd053c7ec4682e35d79d7769d561445ce85cd3e28a8227ee2583b9318237ae` |

### 6.4 Texts

The licence texts the packages above rely on: first the files that ship inside a
package, then the two standard texts that cover the packages declaring an
expression without shipping the text.

Statement of Purpose
The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").
Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.
For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following:
the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, and translate a Work;
moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness depicted in a Work;
rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work;
database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version of such directive); and
other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.
2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.
d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this CC0 or use of the Work.

KEYSIGHT SOFTWARE END-USER LICENSE AGREEMENT 
THE SOFTWARE IS SUBJECT TO THIS END-USER LICENSE AGREEMENT ("EULA"). IF THIS EULA IS PRESENTED ELECTRONICALLY, BY CLICKING "AGREE" YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ITS TERMS. IF THIS EULA IS PRESENTED IN A HARD COPY FORMAT, BY USING THE COMPUTER, INSTRUMENT, OR MACHINE YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ITS TERMS. IF YOU ARE ACCEPTING THIS EULA ON BEHALF OF AN ENTITY, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO BIND SUCH ENTITY. "YOU" MEANS THE INDIVIDUAL OR ENTITY PURCHASING THE LICENSE OR THE USER OF THE SOFTWARE.  
1. Translations. Translations of this EULA are found at: www.keysight.com/find/sweula. 
2. Software. "Software" means a single copy of one or more computer programs licensed by Keysight, whether stand-alone or bundled with other products or solutions, and related documentation, including any online or electronic documentation, data, and license files. 
3. License Grant. Keysight Technologies, Inc. or its subsidiary (collectively, "Keysight") grants you a limited, non-exclusive license to use the Software for the Term (as defined below) for your internal business use in accordance with one of the license types listed below, subject to this EULA and full payment of any applicable fees: 3.1 Node Locked license. If you obtained a Node Locked license, you may install one copy of the Software on one computer, instrument, or machine (collectively, "Computing Device") and use the Software only on that Computing Device. Unless otherwise authorized by Keysight in the Software user guide or other documentation associated with the Software ("Documentation"), you may not display or access the Software on a separate Computing Device. You may not transfer the license to another Computing Device without Keysight's prior written consent and payment of applicable fees.  
3.2 Transportable license. If you obtained a Transportable license, you may use one copy of the Software on any Computing Device at one time. You may move the Software to a different Computing Device using methods made available by Keysight, provided only one copy is in use at any given time. 
3.3 Floating license. If you obtained a Floating license, you may install one or more copies of the Software on any Computing Device within your internal computer network or on dedicated server resources provided by a third party, provided (i) the total number of users or Computing Devices accessing or using the Software at the same time or the total number of copies of the Software executing on Computing Devices at the same time, does not exceed the maximum number of licenses obtained or Computing Devices licensed; and (iii) the users are located within the area (e.g., single site, regional, or worldwide) designated in the order or Documentation. If you purchase a single site, Floating license, you may not use the Software on any network that permits remote access to licensed users located outside the Use Area or permit third parties to use the Software in an on-demand computing environment. "Use Area" means a fifty (50) mile radius from, and within the same time zone as, the geographical site that you occupy as your place of business.  
3.4 Evaluation Licenses. If you obtained an evaluation license, you may use the Software for evaluation purposes only. The evaluation license commences on the date you download the Software and terminates at the end of the Term or sooner if: (i) you purchase a license to the Software; or (ii) Keysight, in its sole discretion, terminates your evaluation license 
You may find the type of license you obtained, the Term of your license, and the number of licenses, if applicable, in Documentation. "Term" means either a set amount of time (an expiring license) or a Perpetual license. For Node Locked licenses, "Perpetual" means the lifetime of the Computing Device. For Transportable and Floating licenses, "Perpetual" means the right to use the license indefinitely. In the absence of documentation specifying the applicable license, you have a Node Locked license with a Perpetual Term.  
4. License Restrictions. 
4.1 No Copies. You may not make copies or adaptations of the Software except for backup and archival purposes or when copying or adaptation is an essential step in the licensed use of the Software, including correction of errors. You must reproduce all copyright and other legal notices in the original Software on all permitted copies or adaptations. 
4.2 No Reverse Engineering. You may not decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, decrypt, modify, create derivative works, or disable security features of the Software, except to the extent any foregoing restrictions are prohibited by applicable law or by licensing terms governing the use of open-source components that may be included with the Software. 
4.3 No Circumvention. The Software may include technological measures, whether in the Software, in bundled hardware, or both (e.g., security servers, security keys or modules, a hardware lock device, license administration software, a license authorization key to control access to the Software) that are designed to prevent or detect installation or use of unlicensed copies of the Software. Such prevention or detection measures may collect and transmit data about suspected unlicensed copies. The data collected does not include any customer data created using the Software. By using the Software, you consent to such detection and collection of data, as well as its transmission and use if suspected unlicensed copies are detected. Circumvention of these technological measures is prohibited, except as expressly permitted by applicable law. Any attempt to circumvent technological measures may render the Software or certain features unusable or unstable and may prevent you from upgrading or updating the Software. Keysight may take all legal steps to prevent unlicensed use of the Software.  
4.4 Limited Use. You may not use the Software to develop products or distribute your own or a third-party's application, if the principal purpose, as reasonably determined by Keysight, is to compete with or perform the same or similar functions as the Software, or to replace any component of the Software. You may not disclose the results of any competitive analysis performed on the Software to any third party. You may not use the Software as training input or prompt-based input into any Generative AI Program. "Generative AI Program" means artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, neural networks, or similar technologies designed to automate the generation or aid in the creation of new content, including but not limited to audio, visual, or text-based content. You may use the output of the Software to train a Generative AI Program provided you comply with the terms of this EULA.

If you are a U.S. government customer, you acknowledge that: (i) you have reviewed this EULA and agree that the license provided for herein is consistent with federal law and otherwise satisfies U.S. government needs; (ii) you agree that this EULA reflects the entirety of the terms of Keysight's customary commercial license applicable to U.S. government customers. No additional government requirements beyond those set forth in this EULA shall apply, except to the extent that those terms, rights, or licenses are explicitly required from all providers of commercial computer software pursuant to the FAR and the DFARS and are set forth specifically in writing elsewhere in this EULA. Keysight has no obligation to update, revise, or otherwise modify the Software. This Section is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFARS, or other provision that addresses government rights in computer software or technical data under this EULA.

NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, IF THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED TO YOU AT NO CHARGE, KEYSIGHT, ITS SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, AND SUPPLIERS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR DIRECT DAMAGES.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
